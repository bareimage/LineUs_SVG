## Usage:
You can simply open the code in [Processing 4.3](https://processing.org/download/), install the [Geomerative] plugin (via Contribution Manager) and run the sketch. Since this plotter is dependent on the SVG functions of Geomerative (flattening and polygonizer) which was finaly updated to support version 4.3
