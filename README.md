# LineUs_SVG
Simple SVG plotter for the LineUs drawbot made with Processing 4.3 and Geomerative Plugin.

## Usage:
You can simply open the code in [Processing 4.3](https://processing.org/download/), install the [Geomerative](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/) plugin (via menu) and run the sketch. Since this plotter is dependent on the SVG functions of Geomerative (flattening and polygonizer) we are stuck with Processing version 2.2.1.

Alternatively you can run the applications for Mac OS and Windows.
